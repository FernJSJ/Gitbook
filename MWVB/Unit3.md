## 1. **ambi**
* **ambi-** from *Latin* means **on both sides** or **around**

* **ambidextrous**
    * ambidextrous people can use their right and left hand equally well

* **ambiguous**
    * (1) Doubtful or uncertain especially from being obscure or indistinct
    * (2) Unclear in meaning because of being understandable in more than one way
    * > Successful politicians are good at ambiguous answers to questions on difficult issues.
    * **ambiguous** comes from *Latin* verb ambigere, **to be undecided**
    * The **ambiguity** of the Mona Lisa's smile makes us wonder what's she thinking about.

* **ambient**
    * Existing or present on all sides
    * > The ambient lighting in the restaurant was low, and there was a bright candle at each table.
    * **Ambient music** is the term used today for "atmospheric" background music usually intended for relaxation or meditation. The candlelit restaurant in the example sentence in probably trying for a romantic **ambience**, or "atmosphere"

* **ambivalent**
    * (1) Holding opposite feelings and attitudes at the same time toward someone or something
    * (2) Continually wavering between opposites or alternative courses of action
    * > He was ambivalent about the trip: he badly wanted to travel but hated to miss the summer activities at home.
    * Since being ambivalent means simply having mixed feelings about some question or issue, some of us spend most of our lives in a state of **ambivalence**.

* **ambit**
    * The range or limit covered by something (such as a law)
    * > The treatment of farm animals generally falls outside the ambit of animal-cruelty laws in the US.

## 2. **epi**
* *Greek* usually means **on, over** or **attached to**

* **epicenter**
    * An earthquake's epicenter os the ground right over the center of the quake.

* **epidermis**
    * Your epidermis is the outer layer of your skin, on top of the inner dermis(真皮).

* **epilogue**
    * The final section after the main part of a book or play
    * > Her editor told her the book really needed an epilogue, to tell where each member of the family is today.
    * *Greek*, **epilogue** means basically "words attached (at the end)".
    * In nonfiction books, we now often use the term afterword instead of epilogue, just as we now generally use foreword instead of prologue. The epilogue of a musical composition, after all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for "tail").

* **epiphyte**
    * An plant that obtains its nutrients from the air and the rain and usually grows on another plant for support
    * > The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyte on a tree branch, drops its tendrils to take root in the ground around the trunk, and slowly covers and strangles the tree to death.  
    * **Epiphytic** plants are somethings known as "air plants" because they seemingly survive on thin air.They rely on their host plants merely for physical support, not nourishment. Tropical **epiphytes** include orchids, ferns, and members of the pineapple family.

* **epitaph**
    * An inscription on a grave or tomb in memory of the one buried there. 
    * > The great architect Christopher Wren designed London's majestic(宏伟的) St. Paul's Cathedral(大教堂), the site of his tomb and epitaph: "Si monumentum requiris, circumspice"("If you seek my monument(纪念碑), look around you").
    * **Epitaph** includes the root from the *Greek* word taphos, **tomb** or **funeral**. 
    * Traditionally, epitaph refers to a tombstone inscription but it can also refer to brief memorial statements that resemble such inscriptions.

* **epithet**
    * (1) A descriptive word or phrase occurring with or in place of the name of a person or things
    * (2) An insulting or demeaning word or phrase
    * > King Richard I of England earned the epithet "Lionhearted", while his brother, King John, was given the epithet "Lackland".
    * *Greek* **epithet** mean something "put on", or added.
    * In its other common meaning an epithet is a mocking or insulting name(like "Lackland"). When enemies are said to be "hurling epithets" at each other, it means they're exchanging angry insults.

## 3. **hyp/hypo**
* *Geek* **below, under**

* **hypodermic**
    * A hypodermic needle injects medication under the skin

* **hypotension**
    * **Hypotension**, or low blood pressure, can be just as unhealthy as the better-known **hypertension**, or high blood pressure.

* **hypochondriac**
    * A person overly concerned with his or her own health who often suffers from delusions of physical disease.
    * > Hercule Poirot, the detective hero of the Agatha Christie mysteries, is a notorious hypochondriac, always trying to protect himself from drafts.
    * One disease a hypochondriac really does suffer from is **hypochondria**, the anxiety and depression that come from worrying too much about one's own health. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of **hypochondria** drives from chondros, the *Greek* word for "cartilage". The cartilage in question is that of the sternum, or breastbone.

* **hypoglycemia**
    * Abnormal decrease of sugar in the blood
    * > She had been controlling her hypoglycemia through diet and vitamins, but she now realized she needed to add daily exercise.
    * *Greek* **glyk-** means **sweet**
    * **Glyc** shows up in the names of various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient, such as **glycerine** and **monoglyceride**. Its opposite, **hyperglycemia** is the main symptom of diabetes, and usually requires an injection of insulin, which the sufferer usually gives himself. Today many people —— though not doctors —— use hypoglycemia to mean a completely different condition, with some of the same milder symptoms, that doesn't involve low blood sugar.

* **hypothermia**
    * Subnormal temperature of the body
    * > By the time rescuers were able to pull the body from the pond's icy waters, hypothermia had reached a life-threatening stage.
    * Hypothermia, which usually results from submersion in icy water or prolonged exposure to cold, may constitute a grave medical emergency.

* **hypothetical**
    * (1) Involving an assumption made for the sake of argument or for further study or investigation
    * (2) Imagined for purposes of example
    * > The candidate refused to say what she would do if faced with a hypothetical military crisis.
    * *Greek* **foundation** or **base** —— that is something **put under** something else.
    * A **hypothesis** is something you assume to be true in  order that you can use it as the base or basis for a line of reasoning —— and any such assumption can be called hypothetical. Once a **hypothesis** has been thoroughly studied and researched without being proved wrong, it generally comes to be called a theory instead.

## 4. **therm/thermo**
* *Greek* **warm**

* **thermometer**
    * A thermometer measures the amount of warmth in a body, the air, or an oven.

* **thermostat**
    * A thermostat makes sure the temperature stays at the same level

* **thermal**
    * (1) Of, relating to, or caused by heat
    * (2) Designed to insulate in order to retain body heat
    * > A special weave called thermal weave taps insulating air in little pockets to increase the warmth of long underwear and blankets.

* **thermodynamics**
    * Physics that deals with the mechanical actions or relations of heat
    * > With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it would be an easy step to a graduate-school concentration in thermodynamics.

* **thermonuclear**
    * Of or relating to the changes in the nucleus of atoms with low atomic weight, such as hydrogen, that require a very high temperature to begin
    * > In the 1950s and 60s, anxious American families built thousands of underground "fallout shelters" to protect themselves from the radiation of a thermonuclear blast.
    * **Nuclear** is the adj for **nucleus**, the main central part of an atom.
    * Why the thermo- in thermonuclear? Because great heat is required to trigger the fusion process, and the trigger used is actually a fission bomb.

* **British thermal unit**
    * The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit at a specified temperature.
    * > Wood-stove manufacturers compete with each other in their claims of how many British thermal units of heat output their stoves can produce.
    * The British thermal unit, or BTU, may be more widely used in North America than in British.
    * The RTU first appeared in 1879 and isn't part of the metric system —— the metric unit of energy id the much smaller joule —— so it isn't much used by scientists, but ist practicality keeps it popular for consumer goods and fuels. A better-known heat unit is the calorie, a BTU is equal to about 252 calorie. (Since the familiar food calorie is actually a kilocalorie, a BTU equals only about a quarter of a food calorie.)
