    * **Equable** usually describes either climate or personality.

* **adequacy**
    * Being equal to some need or requirement
    * > Environmentalists doubt the adequacy of these regulations to protect the wilderness areas.
    * The adj **adequate** means **enough** or **acceptable** —— though in sentences like "His performance was adequate", it really means "no better than acceptable" 

* **equilibrium**
    * (1) A state in which opposing forces are balanced so that one is not stronger or greater than the other
    * (2) A state of emotional balance or calmness
    * > The news had come as a shock, and it took him several minutes to recover his equilibrium.
    * **Libra** *Latin* **weight** or **balance**

* **equinox**
    * A day when day and night are the same length
    * > She and her friends got together for an equinox party twice a year to celebrate the arrival of the fall and the spring.
    * **nox** *Latin* **night**

## 2. **quis**
* *Latin* **to seek or obtain** 
* **quer**, **quir**, and **ques** are derived from the same Latin verb and such as **inquiry** and **question** 

* **inquisition**
    * A questioning or examining that is often harsh or severe
    * > The President's first choice for the job turned him down, fearing the Senate hearings would turn into an inquisition into her past.
    * While an **inquiry** can be almost any search for truth, the related word **inquisition** suggests a long, thorough investigation that involves extensive and harsh questioning.

* **perquisite**
    * (1) A privilege or profit that is provided in addition to one's base salary
    * (2) Something claimed as an exclusive possession or right
    * > A new car, a big house, and yearly trips to Europe were among the perquisites that made the presidency of Wyndam College such an attractive position.
    * Though the Latin source of **perquisite** originally meant **something insistently asked for**, the **ask** meaning has mostly vanished from the English word. A perquisite, often called simply a **perk**, is instead something of value that the holder of a particular job or position is entitled to, usually without even asking.

* **acquisitive**
    * Eager to acquire; greedy
    * > With each year the couple because more madly acquisitive, buying jewelry, a huge yacht, and two country estates.
    * An acquisitive nation may seek to **acquire** other territories by force. But mental **acquisition** of specialized knowledge or skills —— or new vocabulary! —— doesn't deprive others of the same information.


* **requisition**
    * A demand or request (such as for supplies) made with proper authority
    * > The teachers had grown impatient with having to submit a requisition for even classroom supplies.
