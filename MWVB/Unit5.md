    * > The boys didn't take the apples with any malicious intent; they were just hungry and didn't know any better.
    * **Malicious** and **malevolent** are close in meaning, since both refer to ill will that desires to see someone else suffer. But while **malevolent** suggests deep and lasting dislike, **malicious** usually means petty and spiteful. **Malice** is an important legal concept, which has to be proved in order to convict someone of certain crimes such as first-degree murder.

* **malign**
    * To make harsh and often false or misleading statements about
    * > Captain Bligh of the *Bounty* may be one of the most unjustly maligned figures in British naval history.
    * **Malign** is related to verb like **defame**, **slander**, and **libel**. The person or group being maligned is the victim of false or misleading statements, even if the **maligner** isn't necessarily guilty of deliberate lying. **Malign** is also an adj, and writers often refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar **malignant**, which used to be a common synonym of **malign**, today tends to describe dangerous medical conditions, especially cancerous tumors.

    * **Cataclysm**'s original meaning was **flood, deluge**, and especially Noah's Flood itself. An earthquake or other natural disaster that changes the landscape is one kind of cataclysm, but a violent political revolution may also be a **cataclysmic** event. Many cataclysms could instead of called **catastrophes**

* **catacomb**
    * An underground cemetery of connecting passageways with recesses for tombs
    * > The early Christian catacombs of Rome provide a striking glimpse into the ancient past for modern-day visitors.

    * Chemical **catalysts** are substances that, in very small amounts, can bring about important chemical changes in large quantities.

* **orthopedics**
    * The correction or prevention of deformities of the skeleton
    * > For surgery to correct the child's spinal curvature, they were referred to the hospital's orthopedics section.
    * Just as an **orthodontist** corrects crookedness in the teeth, an **orthopedist** corrects crookedness in the skeleton. **Orthopedics** is formed in part from the *Greek* word for **child**, and many **orthopedic** patients are in fact children.

    * In geometry, **rectilinear** usually means **perpendicular**; thus, a rectilinear polygon is a many-sided shape whose angles are all right angles (the footprints of most houses, with their extensions and garages, are good examples). But **rectilinear** is particularly used in physics. **Rectilinear** motion is motion in which the speed remains constant and the path is a straight line; and rectilinear years, such as light rays, travel in a straight line.

    * **Dyspepsia** comes from *Greek* for **bad digestion**. Interestingly, the *Greek* verb pessein can mean either **to cook** or **to digest**, bad cooking has been responsible for a lot of dyspepsia.

## **Latin Borrowings**
* **a fortiori**

    * (1) Made in good faith, without deceit
    * (2) Authentic or genuine
    * > According to the broker, they've made a bona fide offer to buy the property.
    * **Bona fide** means **in good faith** in *Latin*. When applied to business deals and the like, it stresses the absence of fraud or deception.

    * Let the buyer beware
    * > The best rule to keep in mind when buying anything from a pushcart is: "Caveat emptor".
    * **Without a warranty, the buyer must take the risk** is the basic meaning of the phrase **caveat emptor**

    * **Corpus delicti** literally means **body of the crime** in *Latin**. In popular usage, **corpus delicti** also refers to the actual physical object upon which a crime has been committed. In a case of arson, it would be a ruined building; in a murder case, the victim's corpse.

* **curriculum vitae**
    * A short summary of one's career and qualifications, typically prepared by an applicant for a position; resume
    * > The job advertisement asked for an up-to-date curriculum vitae and three recommendations.
    * The *Latin* phrase **curriculum vitae**, often abbreviated CV, literally means **the course of one's life**. A short term is simply **vita**, meaning **life**. In other fields, resume is more commonly used in the US; in England, however, curriculum vitae is the usual term for any job application.
