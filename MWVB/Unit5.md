    * **Malicious** and **malevolent** are close in meaning, since both refer to ill will that desires to see someone else suffer. But while **malevolent** suggests deep and lasting dislike, **malicious** usually means petty and spiteful. **Malice** is an important legal concept, which has to be proved in order to convict someone of certain crimes such as first-degree murder.

* **malign**
    * To make harsh and often false or misleading statements about
    * > Captain Bligh of the *Bounty* may be one of the most unjustly maligned figures in British naval history.
    * **Malign** is related to verb like **defame**, **slander**, and **libel**. The person or group being maligned is the victim of false or misleading statements, even if the **maligner** isn't necessarily guilty of deliberate lying. **Malign** is also an adj, and writers often refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar **malignant**, which used to be a common synonym of **malign**, today tends to describe dangerous medical conditions, especially cancerous tumors.
