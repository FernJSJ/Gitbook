    * Having or showing intense ill will or hatred

* **malicious**
    * Desiring to cause pain, injury, or distress to another
    * > The boys didn't take the apples with any malicious intent; they were just hungry and didn't know any better.
    * **Malicious** and **malevolent** are close in meaning, since both refer to ill will that desires to see someone else suffer. But while **malevolent** suggests deep and lasting dislike, **malicious** usually means petty and spiteful. **Malice** is an important legal concept, which has to be proved in order to convict someone of certain crimes such as first-degree murder.

* **malign**
    * To make harsh and often false or misleading statements about
    * > Captain Bligh of the *Bounty* may be one of the most unjustly maligned figures in British naval history.
    * **Malign** is related to verb like **defame**, **slander**, and **libel**. The person or group being maligned is the victim of false or misleading statements, even if the **maligner** isn't necessarily guilty of deliberate lying. **Malign** is also an adj, and writers often refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar **malignant**, which used to be a common synonym of **malign**, today tends to describe dangerous medical conditions, especially cancerous tumors.

    * **-clysm** *Greek* **to wash**
    * **Cataclysm**'s original meaning was **flood, deluge**, and especially Noah's Flood itself. An earthquake or other natural disaster that changes the landscape is one kind of cataclysm, but a violent political revolution may also be a **cataclysmic** event. Many cataclysms could instead of called **catastrophes**

* **catacomb**
    * An underground cemetery of connecting passageways with recesses for tombs
