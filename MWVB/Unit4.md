* The days leading up to Lent are known as the **carnival** season, from the Italian **carnelevare**, later shortened to **carnvale**, which meant "removal of meat" —— though during carnival, of course, people indulge in  just about everything , and the removal of meat only comes later.

    * In Christianity in past centuries, **carnal** was often used as the opposite of **spiritual**, describing what are sometimes called "the pleasures of the flesh". Today **carnal** has a somewhat old-fashioned sound; when we use it, we generally mean simply "sexual"
