## 1. **vor**
* *Latin* **to eat**
* the ending **-ivorous** shows up in words that refer to eaters of certain kinds of food

* **Frugivorous**
    * **fruit-eating**

* **granivorous**
    * **gain-eating**

* **graminivorous**
    * **grass-eating**

* **phytosuccivorous**
    * **plant-sap-eating**

* **carnivorous**
    * Meat-eating or flesh-eating
    * > He'd gotten tired of his vegetarian guinea pigs(豚鼠) and decided he preferred carnivorous pets such as ferrets(雪貂).
    * Humans, like their ape cousins, are basically **omnivores**.

* **herbivorous**
    * Plant-eating
    * > In spite of their frightening appearance, marine iguanas are peaceable herbivorous animals that feed mostly on seaweed.
    * But such behavior is not universal among **herbivores**. Herbivorous humans are usually called **vegetarians**.

* **insectivorous**
    * Feeding on insects.
    * > Their rather odd 12-year-old son kept insectivorous plants in his bedroom and fed them live flies.
    * **insectivores**

* **voracious**
    * Having a huge appetite
    * > One of the hardest parts of dieting is watching skinny people with voracious appetites consume large amounts of food without gaining weight.

## 2. **carn**
* *Latin* **flesh** or **meat**
* **carnation**
    * the color of flesh

* The days leading up to Lent are known as the **carnival** season, from the Italian **carnelevare**, later shortened to **carnvale**, which meant "removal of meat" —— though during carnival, of course, people indulge in  just about everything , and the removal of meat only comes later.

* **carnage**
    * Great destruction of life (as in a battle); slaughter
    * > Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to stop the carnage of the war in Bosnia.
    
* **carnal**
    * Having to do with bodily pleasures
    * > The news stories about students on Spring Break tend to focus on the carnal pleasures associated with the annual ritual.
    * In Christianity in past centuries, **carnal** was often used as the opposite of **spiritual**, describing what are sometimes called "the pleasures of the flesh". Today **carnal** has a somewhat old-fashioned sound; when we use it, we generally mean simply "sexual"

* **incarnate**
    * Given bodily or actual form; especially, having human body
    * > For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as goodness incarnate.
    * Jesus as the **incarnation** of God. **incarnate** soon began to be used with various nouns:"the devil incarnate". Notice that **incarnate** is one of rare adjectives that usually, but not always, follows its noun. **Incarnate** is also a verb, though with a slightly different pronunciation:"This report simply incarnates the prejudices od its authors," "For her followers, she incarnates the virtue of selflessness," etc.

* **reincarnation**
    * (1) Rebirth in new bodies or forms of life
    * (2) Someone who has been born again with a new body after death
    * > Even as a child he struck everyone as reincarnation of his grandfather, not in his features but in his manner and personality.

## 3. **cred**
* *Latin* **to believe** or **to entrust**

* **credit**
    * We have a good credit rating when institutions trust in our ability to repay a loan

* **credential**
    * We carry credentials so that others will believe that we are who we say we are

* **credence**
    * Mental acceptance of something as true or real; believe
    * > He scoffed(laugh at) and said no one still gives any credence to the story of the Loch Ness monster(尼斯湖怪兽).
    * **Credence** is close in meaning to **belief**, but there are differences. Unlike belief, **credence** is seldom used in connection with faith in a religion or philosophy. Instead **credence** is often used in reference to reports, rumors, and opinions. And, unlike belief, it tends to be used with the words give, lack, lend, and gain. So a new piece of evidence may lend credence to the alibi of criminal suspect.

* **credible**
    * (1) Able to be believed; reasonable to trust or believe
    * (2) Good enough to be effective
    * > Because of her past criminal record, the defense lawyers knew she wouldn't be a credible witness.
    * **Credible** means **believable**, then noun **credibility** means **believability**. (But we no longer use **incredible** to mean the literal opposite of **credible**, just as we no longer use **unbelievable** as the literal opposite of **believable**.) Since cred is short for **credibility**, "street cred" is the kind of credibility among tough young people that you can only get by proving yourself on the mean streets of the inner city.

* **credulity**
    * Readiness and willingness to believe on the basis of little evidence.
    * > Thrillers and action movies only succeed if they don't strain our credulity too much.
    * The related adj is **credulous**. F.Scott Fitzgerald once defined advertising as "making dubious promises to a credulous public"

* **credo**
    * (1) A statement of the basic beliefs of a religious faith
    * (2) A set of guiding principles or beliefs
    * > She claims she made her money on Wall Street just by following the old credo "Buy low, sell high."
    * **Credo** comes straight from the Latin word meaning "I believe", and is the first word of many religious credos, or **creeds**, such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. But the word can be applied to any guiding principle or set of principles. Here is the credo of the writer H.L.Mencken, written after he had lived quite a few years:"I believe that it is better to tell the truth than the lie. I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe that it is better to know than to be ignorant."

## 4. **fid**
* *Latin* **faith** or **trust**
* And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin for "I trust"

* **fidelity**
    * Fidelity is another word for **faithfulness**

* **confidence**
    * Confidence is having faith in someone or something

* **infidel**
    * An infidel is someone who lacks a particular kind of religious faith

* **affidavit**
    * A sworn statement made in writing
    * > The whole family had signed affidavits stating that they believed the will to be valid.
    * In Latin, **affidavit** means **he(she) has sworn an oath**, and an affidavit is always a sworn written document. Affidavits (unlike similar signed statements called **depositions**) are usually made without an opposing lawyer being present and able to ask questions.

* **diffident**
    * Lacking confidence; timid, cautions
    * > He always found it a struggle to get his most diffident students to speak in front of the class.
    * **Diffident** means lacking faith in oneself —— in other words, the opposite of **confidence**. Distrust in your abilities or opinions usually makes you hesitate to speak or act. Patients who feel diffident around their doctors. A helpful friend tries to instill confidence in place of diffidence. 

* **fiduciary**
    * (1) Having to do with a confidence or trust
    * (2) Held in trust for another
    * > Pension-found managers have a fiduciary responsibility to invest the pension's funds for the sole benefit of those who will receive the pensions.
    * A fiduciary relationship is one in which one person places faith in another.

* **perfidy**
    * Faithlessness, disloyalty, or treachery
    * > While working for the CIA he wa lured into becoming a double agent, and it seems the paid a high price for his perfidy.
    * perfidious —— an act that made his name a synonym for traitor

## 5. **curr/curs**

    * refer to running water in a stream or river, or electrons running through a wire

* **excursion**
    * a trip from one place to another

* **concurrent**
    * Happening or operating at the same time

* **cursory**
    * Hastily and often carelessly done
    * > Having spent the weekend going to parties, she had only given the chapter a cursory reading before class on Monday.
    * Unlike the other words in this section, **cursory** always implies speed. But it also stresses a lack of attention to detail.

* **discursive**
    * Passing from one topic to another
    * > Some days he allowed himself to write long discursive essays in his diary instead of his usual simple reporting of the days events.
    * **discursive**, means rambling about over a wide range of topics.

* **precursor**
    * One that goes before and indicates the coming of another
    * > Scientists are trying to identify special geological activity that may be an earthquake, which will help hem predict the quake's size, time, and location.
    * **pre-** means **before**
    * A **precursor** is literally a **forerunner**. But the two words function a little differently today. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, but a precursor generally paves the way for something.

    * A pedal is pushed by the foot

* **pedicure**

* **impediment**
    * Something that interferes with movement or progress
    * > Her poorly developed verbal ability was the most serious impediment to her advancement.
    * In English, **impediment** still suggests an obstruction or obstacle along a path. **Impediments** usually get in the way of something we want. So we may speak of an impediment to communication, marriage, or progress —— but something that that slows the progress of aging, disease, or decay is rarely called an impediment.

* **pedestrian**
    * Commonplace, ordinary, or unimaginative
    * > While politicians endlessly discussed the great issues facing Russia, the Russians worried about such pedestrian concerns as finding enough food, shelter, and clothing.
    * **Pedestrian** as a noun meaning someone who travels on foot. **Pedestrian** is often used to describe a colorless or lifeless writing style, but it can also describe politicians, public tastes, personal qualities, or possessions.

    * (2) The change in form of a word showing its case, gender, number, person, tense, mood, voice, or comparison

    * > The postmodern AT&T building in New York, with the "Chippendale" top that reminds viewers of an antique dresser, aroused a storm of criticism.
